# UFO

## Overview of Project
We are helping to revamp Dana's UFO sightings webpage to provide a deeper analysis to allow users to filter on many different variables at the same time. The table filters we will be adding are city, country, state & shape, which is already on top of the date filter we currently have. 

## Results

Using the index.html file, we can open up our webpage. Once the webpage is open we can filter on all of the different variables at the same time in order to filter down our UFO sightings into smaller groups. We can filter by date, city, country, state & shape of the sighting. See below for a screenshot of the webpage.
